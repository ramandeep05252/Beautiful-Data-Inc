# EV Charging Stations Strategy

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) charging patterns and strategies across different localities, including metropolitan and regional areas. The primary goal is to understand the motivation behind EV charging behaviors and how these are influenced by factors such as the type of EV, locality, and potential fuel savings.

## Key Components

- **Locality Analysis:**  
  Examine charging patterns in metropolitan versus regional areas, identifying key motivators for EV owners in different settings.

- **EV Type Influence:**  
  Analyze how the type of EV (e.g., fully electric vehicles (FCEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)) impacts charging habits and savings.

- **Charging Locations:**  
  Explore the significance of charging at home, at work, and at other public or private stations.

- **Savings Analysis:**  
  Evaluate the annual maintenance and fuel savings associated with different charging behaviors, providing insights into the economic benefits of EV ownership.

## Data Visualization

The project includes interactive visualizations developed in Tableau, offering a comprehensive view of the data, such as:

- The distribution of EVs across Australia.
- The correlation between EV type and annual fuel savings.
- A breakdown of charging habits by locality.

These insights are crucial for stakeholders aiming to optimize EV charging infrastructure and encourage the adoption of electric vehicles.
